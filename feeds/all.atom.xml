These systems are commonly Internet-facing. The flaw has been assigned a bug alert severity of 'critical', and the vendor has supplied patches.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, February 8, 2022, &lt;a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/08/sap-partners-with-onapsis-to-identify-and-patch-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities/"&gt;SAP published a notice detailing a major request smuggling flaw&lt;/a&gt; within their SAP NetWeaver, SAP Content Server, and SAP Web Dispatcher products, which SAP claims could lead to authentication bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly available documentation is scarce, but the Bug Alert team has analyzed &lt;a href="https://github.com/Onapsis/onapsis_icmad_scanner/blob/master/src/ICMAD_scanner.py"&gt;the PoC&lt;/a&gt; and SAP documentation. It appears that SAP &lt;a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/e815bb97839a4d83be6c4fca48ee5777/7.5.21/en-US/4a47abb3e1f41cd4e10000000a421937.html"&gt;can utilize the &lt;code&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/code&gt; header&lt;/a&gt; (which is usually stripped from untrusted traffic) to authenticate a user through an authenticating proxy or SSO module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, publicly available information is limited at this time, but it appears likely that this request smuggling issue could be utilized to insert the &lt;code&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/code&gt; request header and impersonate another SAP user, including the present-by-default 'Administrator' account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2022-22536. Patches are available now from the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you haven't already, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BugAlertDotOrg"&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. While notices are also posted to Twitter, we'll also use the platform for disseminating less pressing, informational content, such as minor feature enhancements or bugfixes. Notices will always be tagged with &lt;code&gt;#BugAlertNotice&lt;/code&gt;, which you can use for filtering alerts if you are utilizing tools like IFTTT to monitor the feed and only want to see the emergency stuff. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Bug Alert News"></category><category term="Telegram"></category><category term="Slack"></category></entry><entry><title>Bug Alert is Live</title><link href="https://bugalert.org/content/notices/2022-01-04-bugalert.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-04T14:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-04T14:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Bug Alert Contributors</name></author><id>tag:bugalert.org,2022-01-04:/content/notices/2022-01-04-bugalert.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!
